I am trying to create a range of categories in which web pages of university websites could be classified under. Examples of university websites that I am looking at are nus.edu.sg, www.ntu.edu.sg, sutd.edu.sg, www.sim.edu.sg, www.singaporetech.edu.sg, smu.edu.sg. I have briefly browsed through the webpages of these websites and these are some of the categories I could identify: Page about the university/faculty, Information about curriculum, News articles, Research articles, Login pages, IT help pages, Information about staff (names, offices, contact details). Could you assist me in generating a comprehensive list of categories in which we could classify the web pages of the websites of these universities?
